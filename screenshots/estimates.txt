The minimum RTO for a single AZ outage is estaimted 1 hour as this would involve creating a new RDS db from the snapshot in another AZ, which takes a few minutes, as well as having the alarm detecting the failure and alerting the on-call engineer and having on-call engineer diagnosing the issue.  I would estimate the minimum RTO for a single region outage to be 1 hour as well since the failover to RDS on another region also takes a few minutes.  As for the minimum RPO, it is estimated to be The minimum RPO for a single AZ outage and single region outage would be 30 minute as the default replica frequency is 30 minute.
