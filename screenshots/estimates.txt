The minimum RTO for a single AZ outage is estaimted to be under 30 minutes as we can automate the launch the recovered instance in another availability zone, and AWS's documentation states that the spinning off a new EC2 instance would take under 30 minutes.  The minimum RTO for a single region failure is estimated to be 1 hour as this would involve creating a new RDS db from the snapshot in another AZ, as well as having the alarm detecting the failure and alerting the on-call engineer and having on-call engineer diagnosing the issue.  I would estimate the minimum RTO for a single region outage to be 1 hour as well since the failover to RDS on another region also takes a few minutes.  As for the minimum RPO, it is estimated to be The minimum RPO for a single AZ outage is 5 minutes (the interval required for copying transaction logs to Amazon S3) and single region outage would be 30 minute (the default replica frequency is 30 minute).
